              Since I was a kid I always liked to use computers. I remember that
              my father had the computer at work and I was curious to see what
              it could do. This curiosity about computers led me to follow
              secondary education in Informatics. So, in those 3 years I spent
              at Rocha Peixoto school in Povoa de Varzim, I learned the basics
              of programming with C and Visual Basic.

              When choosing to go to the university, I decided to change the
              branch and chose a Logistics management area. I studied in Valen√ßa
              do Minho at the Higher School of Business Sciences and after the
              course I worked 1 year in a logistics warehouse. The passion for
              computers never ceased to exist and even in a management area, I
              continued to practice programming in the area of Web development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over time I saw that it was not that area I wanted to follow and I
              decided to go back to studying, so I signed up I was at the
              Instituto Politecnico do Cavado e Ave in the Computer Systems
              Engineering Degree and for 3 years I studied at night while
              working during the day in the Sonae group.

              My first professional experience was as an Omnis programmer at
              Prozis, on a professional internship, where I made interfaces with
              Omnis Studio and queries to the database with SQL Server.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of the degree I started working at GlinttHS, in
              September 2017 where I worked as a Web Developer on 3 different
              projects. During this professional experience I decided to enroll
              in the Master of Informatics Engineering, in 2018, in order to
              deepen more knowledge.
            </p>

              In 2019 I started a new professional challenge at the startup
              Cocus Portugal where I worked for a German client.

              On my free time I like to go to the Gym, do some physical activity
              and at home I like to always be with an active project. In recent
              times I have been working more with NodeJS, ReactJS and MongoDB
              technologies. I also like to host my applications on Github,
              Docker and Netlify
